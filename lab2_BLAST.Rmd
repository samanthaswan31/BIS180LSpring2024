Download files from web:
```
weget https://webaddress.com/downloads
```

First step of header lines in a refseq file:
```
gunzip -c patientseq.txt.gz | head -1
```

Search for a term within a file:
Example with grep = how many viruses come from a domesticated cat
```
zgrep -c "Felis catus" refseq.txt.gz
```

Example with cut = how many viruses were isolated in the U.S.
```
cut -f 5 -d "|" | zgrep -c "United States" refseq.txt.gz
```
f = select only these fields and print any line with no delimiter character
