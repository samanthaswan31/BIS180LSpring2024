For loop is a method of iterating over series of values and performing an operation on each value

**Linux For Loops**
First create list to iterate over:
```
example_list = "example1 example2 example3" #creates variable example_list
```

Refer to variable after defined with a $ in front, optional curly brackets
```
echo "${example_list} #prints contents of example_list
```

Template for for loops:
```
for example in ${example_list} 
  do
    echo "${example}" #command of choice
  done
```

Example: make list plural
```
for example in ${example_list} 
  do
    echo "${example}s" #placement of brackets distinguishes
  done
```

**Interacting with Files**
Common use for for loops is processing a list of files

Example of processing a list of files:
```
for file in ${myfiles}
  do
    cat ${file} #prints contents of all files in directory myfiles
  done
```

Example of processing list of files: file file1.txt contains: text
```
for file in $myfiles
  do
    echo "file ${file} contains:" $(cat ${file})
  done
```

**Nested For Loops**
Create dataset for example:
```
days="mon tue wed thur fri"
hours="09 10 11 12 01 02 03 04 05"
```


If want a loop within a loop:
```
for day in $days #first for loop goes through days
  do
    for hour in $hours #second for loop goes through hours
      do
        echo "It is ${hour}:00 on ${day}" #echo desired statement
    done
  echo " "
done
```
It is time:00 on day (9-5 on each day of the days)
